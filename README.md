# Decentralized Notes

## Project Description

- This project, developed by Paras Raut, is a simple Ethereum Decentralized Application (DApp) that showcases the power of Ethereum smart contracts and Ethers.js integration. The DApp allows users to store and retrieve messages on the Ethereum blockchain, demonstrating the core functionalities of a blockchain-based application.

## **Key Features:**

**Smart Contract:** 
- The project includes a Solidity-based smart contract that enables users to securely store messages on the Ethereum blockchain and retrieve them when needed.

**User-Friendly Frontend:** 
- The frontend of this DApp is built using ReactJS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Users can easily interact with the smart contract by entering new messages and fetching existing ones.

**Ethers.js Integration:** 
- The primary reason for using "ethresjs" instead of Web3.js could be personal preference, as "ethresjs" might offer a more intuitive and suitable solution for the specific requirements of your Ethereum DApp. Additionally, it could have specialized features, be lightweight, or provide recent improvements that make it a better fit for your project.

**Testing:** 
- Comprehensive tests for the smart contract functions are included to ensure the correctness and reliability of the DApp under different scenarios.

## Problem Statement
### - **You are required to build a simple Ethereum DApp with the following features**
**Smart Contract:** Create an Ethereum smart contract using Solidity.
- Allow users to store a string message on the blockchain.
- Allow users to retrieve the stored message from the blockchain


## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain Platform**: **Ethereum Blockchain** 
  
- **Smart Contracts**: **Solidity** - A python-inspired language and ecosystem we use for writing highly efficient Ethereum Blockchain smart contracts.
  
- **Web Framework**: 
    - **React.js** - Powers the frontend of our platform, ensuring a reactive, efficient, and modular UI.

- **UI Styling**: 
    - **Flowbite css** - A utility-first CSS framework we use for rapid UI development.

### Frontend Dependencies:

- **Metamask Wallet Integration**
